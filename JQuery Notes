JQuery Notes

Selectors are used to select content and Filtersa are used to further refine the selected content.

Altering Document Content
wrap(): wrap the matched elements with the specified content
wrapAll(): wrap content around the matched elements as a group
unWrap(): remove the parents from the matched elements
empty(): remove all the child elements from the matched elements
remove(): removes elements from the page, including any embedded data and event handlers
detach(): removes elements from the page, but maintains embedded data and event handlers
replaceAll(): replaces the matched elements with the specified content
replaceWith(): replaces matched elements with content or the results of a callback function

Manipulating Attributes
To read or change element attributes, use the attr() function. removeAttr() can be used to remove attributes

attr(): get the value of an attribute
attr(name, val): set the name attribute to val
attr({ name: val ... }): set multiple attributes in one call
removeAttr(name): remove the attribute from the element

CSS Properties and Class Manipulation
Getting and setting CSS information is accomplished via a set of dedicated jQuery functions.

In addition to setting and retrieving individual CSS properties, there are methods for easily changing the CSS classes assigned to page elements that work in a cross-browser manner.

css(): get or set CSS properties on the matched elements in a variety of ways
hasClass(className): determine whether a page element has a certain class
addClass(className | function): add the given CSS class to the elements in the matched set
removeClass(className | function): remove the given CSS class from the elements in the matched set
